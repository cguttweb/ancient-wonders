        <h1>Hanging Gardens of Babylon</h1>
        <p>It is now thought that these gardens were close to the Euphrates in Iraq and were built by Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II between 605-562BCE for his wife Amytis of Media. They were described by ancient writer Diodorus Siculus as self-watering planes of greenery achieving a height of 23m through a series of climbing terraces. He says the rulers wife missed forests and mountains of her homeland and Nebuchadnezzar declared that a mountain should be made in Babylon for her.</p>
        <p>Much of the controversy over whether they existed comes from the lack of mention in Babylonian history and the so-called "father of history" Herodotus. Other writers Strabo, Philo and Diodorus, however do mention them and claim they existed but were destroyed by earthquake at some point after 1st century AD it is unclear. It is generally accepted as a popular myth.</p>
