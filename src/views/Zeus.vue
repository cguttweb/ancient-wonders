        <h1>Statue of Zeus at Olympia</h1>
        <p>This much celebrated statue was made by Athenian sculptor Phidias and palced in the Sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia (the site of ancient Olympics) in mid-5th century BCE. It shows him in a position of authority with skin made of ivory and the robes of gold standing 12m tall to inspire and awe ancient visitors. Two carved sphinxes with chests and heads of women, birds' wings and lions' bodies are the armrests.</p>
        <p>The statue remained at Olympia for 800 years, but under the direction of Christian advisors Roman ruler Constantine was encouraged to shut down the sanctuary in 4th century AD. It was moved from the sanctuary to Constantinople and is thought to have been destroyed by fire in 462AD.</p>
